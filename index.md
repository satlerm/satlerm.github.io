    <p> <strong> Stand up paddle surfing </strong> and <strong> stand up paddle boarding (SUP) </strong> is an offshoot o
      surfing that originated in Hawaii. Unlike traditional surfing where the rider sits until a wave comes, stand up paddle
      boarders stand on their boards and use paddle to propel themselves through the water. The sport was documented in a 2013
      report that identified it as the outdoor
      sporting activity with the most first-time participants in the United States that year.[1] Variations include flat water
      paddling for outdoor recreation, fitness, or sightseeing, racing on lakes, large rivers and canals, surfing on ocean
      waves, paddling in river rapids (whitewater SUP), url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_board_yoga Paddle board yoga
      and even fishing. </p>
