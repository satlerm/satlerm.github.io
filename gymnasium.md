    <p> <strong> Stand up paddle surfing </strong> and <strong> stand up paddle boarding (SUP) </strong> is an offshoot o
      surfing that originated in Hawaii. Unlike traditional surfing where the rider sits until a wave comes, stand up paddle
      boarders stand on their boards and use paddle to propel themselves through the water. The sport was documented in a 2013
      report that identified it as the outdoor
      sporting activity with the most first-time participants in the United States that year.[1] Variations include flat water
      paddling for outdoor recreation, fitness, or sightseeing, racing on lakes, large rivers and canals, surfing on ocean
      waves, paddling in river rapids (whitewater SUP), url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_board_yoga Paddle board yoga
      and even fishing.

      <h1> History </h1> 
      <p> Standup paddleboarding (SUP), the act of propelling oneself on a floating platform with the help
      of a paddle or pole, traces back to thousands of years ago and across many continents, but its current
      form and popularity originated in Hawaii in the 1900s. Records of earlier forms of SUP have been found
      as early as 1,000 <abbr aria-label="Before Christ">B.C.</abbr> (i.e. 3,000 years ago) and its iterations
      span over various regions such
      as Peru, Israel, Italy, China, and beyond. By contrast, the modern form of stand up paddle
      boarding, where a surfboard-like vessel is used, has a much clearer heritage, dating back to the 1900s
      and emerging from a collection of loosely related activities by a few very specific characters, such
      as Duke Kahanamoku and Dave Kalama. Once it reached California in the early 2000s, stand up
      paddling formed four epicenters, each with its own fountainhead: Rick Thomas (San Diego), Ron House
      (Dana Point/San Clemente), Laird Hamilton (Malibu) and Bob Pearson (Santa Cruz). From there, the
      sport gained exponential popularity and California served as the catalyst for worldwide adoption. 
      By 2005, SUP, which had till then been almost entirely a surfing discipline, began to 
      diversify into racing, touring, rivers, yoga, and fishing. Its surfing heritage coupled
      with its various disciplines made the sport attractive and accessible to everyone all
      over the world, paving the way for its global growth and enthusiastic adoption. </p>
